# Bank Statement Data Processing Pipeline

## Project Overview
A Python-based data processing pipeline for automating the consolidation, cleaning, and categorization of bank statements from multiple sources and formats. The system transforms raw bank statement data into structured, analyzable formats while maintaining data lineage and integrity.

## Key Features
- [ ] Raw data validation and integrity checks
- [ ] Multi-format support (CSV, Excel) with uniform output
- [ ] Date standardization to ISO format
- [ ] Monthly data consolidation
- [ ] Automated transaction categorization based on historical patterns
- [ ] Data lineage tracking

## Architecture

### Data Flow
```
raw bank statements → validation → cleaning → normalization → categorization → analysis
```

### Directory Structure
```

│   ├── raw/          # Original bank statements (versioned)
│   ├── processed/    # Cleaned, normalized data
│   ├── interim/      # Intermediate processing states
│   └── schemas/      # Expected format definitions

└── main.py          # Pipeline entry point
```

### Core Components

#### DataLoader
Responsible for:
- Validating data directory structure
- Detecting and loading supported file formats
- Initial data integrity checks
- Schema validation

#### DataTransformer (Future)
Handles:
- Date standardization
- Column name normalization
- Data type conversion
- Missing value handling

#### Categorizer (Future)
Manages:
- Historical pattern analysis
- Transaction categorization rules
- Category mapping and validation

### Data Models
The system uses strongly-typed dataclasses to ensure data consistency:
- TransactionRecord
- CategoryMapping
- ProcessedStatement
- ValidationSchema

## Development Approach
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Functional programming paradigms
- Type hints throughout
- Continuous Integration/Deployment
- README-driven development

## Technical Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Poetry for dependency management
- pandas and openpyxl for data processing
- pytest for testing
- mypy for type checking

## Usage
(To be expanded as features are implemented)

## Development Workflow
1. Create issue for new feature/fix
2. Branch from main (`feat/feature-name`)
3. Write tests
4. Implement feature
5. Review and refactor
6. Merge back to main

## Current Status
- [x] Project structure established
- [ ] Basic data validation
- [ ] File format detection
- [ ] Data loading implementation
- [ ] Transformation pipeline
- [ ] Categorization engine

## Next Steps
1. Implement basic DataLoader functionality
2. Add support for multiple file formats
3. Develop date standardization
4. Create transaction record data models
5. Build categorization engine
